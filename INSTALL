The standard setup is to install the wysiwygit and ckeditor directories in your 
site's home directory.  This way all of your site's files may be edited.

An alternative setup is to install the wysiwygit and ckeditor directories 
in a subdirectory on your site.  In this case only files and subdirectories
within that subdirectory may be edited.
